{"name":"HTPCPortal (Test Branch)","body":"The HTPCPortal is a PHP based 'wrapper' for use on your home network, providing quick access to all of your HTPC related apps and sites as well as other commonly used sites. Although there are other 'consolidation' sites out there, like [Maraschino](http://maraschinoproject.com), which incorporates information from multiple HTPC Apps in a great fashion, sometimes there's a need to quickly swap between the actual applications as opposed to just viewing partial info.\r\n\r\n![preview thumb](https://photos-1.dropbox.com/i/o/u6TwI5WLm7i8clWRwQSKkWs8pyCpHVF9l6AOvIYRIas/55460583/1337936400/fe03233/HTPCPortal-Home.png)\r\n\r\n![ipad version](https://photos-3.dropbox.com/i/o/MR_bPRclfLzfu9-e16HCCobeMH5m87qvUt0OLtpYhrk/55460583/1337936400/aae7beb/iPad-FullScreen.png)\r\niPad specific version made to utilize it's native 1024x768 screen resolution.

This site was tested against a Pre-Frodo Nightly build (May 16, 2012) and all is working.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSpecial Notes:<br />\r\n\tPrior to loading the site for the first time, please rename 'settings-default.ini' to 'settings.ini' and fill in each of the fields. If you 'forget' this step, there are defaults built in that 'may' work if you run each app on the same system and with their default port. When entering information in the settings.ini (other than RSS section) do not include special characters or surround your input in quotes.\r\n\r\n\t[Host]\r\n\txbmc\t\t=\tlocalhost\r\n\txport\t\t=\t8080\r\n\txbmcuser\t=\txbmc\r\n\txbmcpass\t=\txbmc\r\n\t[...]\r\n\tmara\t\t=\t192.168.1.2\r\n\tmaraport\t=\t7000\r\n\t[...] etc.\r\n\t\r\n\t[APIKeys]\t\t// This section is not currently used, ignore if you'd like.\r\n\tsabapi\t\t=\txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  // API for SabNZBd+\r\n\tsbapi\t\t=\txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  // API for SickBeard\r\n\tmatrixapi\t=\txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  // API for NZBMatrix.com\r\n\tnzbsuapi\t=\txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  // API for NZB.su\r\n\t\r\n\t[RSS]\r\n\trsscount\t=\t0\t// The number of entries you want shown. 0 = All available\r\n\tfeed1name\t=\tMovies\r\n\tfeed1\t\t=\thttp%3A%2F%2Frss.nzbmatrix.com%2Frss.php%3Fpage%3Ddetails%26subcat%3D1%26english%3D1\r\n\t[...]\r\n\tfeed5name\t=\t\"<img src=\"includes/images/engadget_iconsm.png\" width=\"14\" height=\"14\" />\"\r\n\tfeed5\t\t=\thttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Frss.xml\r\n\r\n\t/** To get the required format for your RSS feed, open the site and click \"Remote\" from\r\n\tthe top navigation.

The simple answer is, I got drunk after I made my third (maybe fourth) commit to the first repo and decided I wanted to be safe and create a secondary place for testing... and, oops. Wrong option, but works just the same.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMore detailed information will be included later...","tagline":"Beta Platform for 'HTPCPortal' (Things on this branch will probably break often)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
